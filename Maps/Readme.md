# Reference Maps & Pictures #

Collection of Graphical Reference Maps showing all the button/toggle/axis layouts. Included is both an Advanced & Basics Map _(for beginners)_ plus printable versions. There are also some specific functional pictures to assist.

## Beginner's Map ##
If you are new to the game (or this script), the below map offers an overview of all the core game functions to help get you in the cockpit and piloting ASAP.

## Advanced Map ##
This map contains every command currently mapped in the script and bindings files. Including all Modifier combinations.

Although it looks like many of these would conflict, being mapped to the same toggle/buttons, most are situational allowing multiple commands to be mapped to the same location. All mappings have been carefully placed to ensure no conflicts, and to give easy access to commonly used commands (while lower frequency commands may use a Modifier or a harder to reach button, for example).

## LED Map ##
Full LED Lighting implemented for core Ship Systems, plus full LED Backlight manual control for the Throttle, and an initialisation sequence on startup.

You can also Dim your Throttle Backlights automatically when you enable your Ship/SRV Lights or Night Vision.

## Custom Plates ##
If Elite Dangerous is your main game used on your Thrustmaster Warthog/Pit, the conventional 21st Century A10 Warthog markings on the throttle facia plate may not seem like the best fit for a modern 35th Century space sim. 

Thanks to the fantasticly creative community member __Tekadept__, you can replace these default plates with ones specifically designed for this script! These are made of a black on white engraving material which diffuses the LEDs nicely.

I'm sharing it here for visibility for CMDRS using the script as I think it is simply an awesome mod!

Please direct any queries to __Tekadept__ via his [website](https://www.tekcreations.space/contact-us/ "Contact TekCreations"). Individual tweaks & customisations are also available.

## Keyboard Map ##
These keyboard commands are used to map to both HOTAS and to Voice Attack.

They should not have to be used directly, but listed here for easy reference:

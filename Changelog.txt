Update 4.3.0: ISOLATION OBSERVANCE (Update #25)

-> Some small improvements based on user feedback and alignment to changes in Fleet Carriers update.


New to the script? Be sure to also check out the Beginners Reference Map in the download pack to get started.


List of Changes:

NEW: Set Custom Deadzone on Slew Axes on the Throttle Arm for better FA Off lateral thruster control. Change via the new SLEW_DEADZONE user preference. (Thx Berndserk for the suggestion!)
NEW: In-game Store Page axis/buttons are now mappped to Joystick Axes (Move Camera) & Throttle Slew on Arm (Zoom). KeyMap also updated with Store Page for script integration.
NEW: Hangar Automation Routine Macro added. After touch-down & station menu appears this can be used to automatically refuel, repair & restock your ship using the new UI buttons while entering the hangar. This is currently mapped to the Autopilot button (on Throttle base) + Long Press + Pinky Trigger (basically the same routine for Autodock but a long hold instead), and can be customised in the user preferences. Regardless of your status, it will attempt to return you to 100% for each refuel/repair/restock while you decend into the ship hangar.

IMPROVEMENT: Separate Throttle Axis mappings are now possible. Map the Left Throttle axis to something else (eg. FSS Tuning?) while keeping Right mapped for Ship/SRV. Also, the Left Axis will no longer be impacted by Throttle Preset changes allowing Full Range + Forward Only combos! Use the new SyncLEFTTHRAxis user preference to set behaviour. (Thx dmakaitis for the code!)
IMPROVEMENT: Throttle Axis Mapping code has been upgraded to more efficient layout. (Thx dmakaitis for the code!)
IMPROVEMENT: Added SetSpeed0 command into the Auto-Launch function to prevent premature acceleration away from pad.

FIXED: Joystick 'JS_DEADZONE' variable not taking effect. (Thx Berndserk for the report!)
FIXED: Fast Mode Switching Macro is now aligned for the latest UI changes in main menus.
